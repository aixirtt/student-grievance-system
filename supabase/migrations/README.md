# This file contains documentation for database migrations in Supabase.

## Overview

This directory contains migration files for the Supabase database used in the Student Grievance System for Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila's College of Engineering. Migrations are used to manage changes to the database schema over time.

## Migration Files

Each migration file should be named in a way that reflects the changes it introduces, typically following a format like `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_description.sql`. 

## Running Migrations

To apply migrations, use the Supabase CLI or the Supabase dashboard. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to modify the database schema.

## Best Practices

- Always create a backup of your database before applying new migrations.
- Test migrations in a development environment before applying them to production.
- Document any changes made in the migration files for future reference.
